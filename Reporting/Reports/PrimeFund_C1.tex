\noindent\textbf{\color{lucid_blue}Notes}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Target returns based on the program manager's estimate of the projected returns for the respective series based on current market conditions. 

\item Current return (estimated) is based on the rates of the invested series portfolio as of the current period start date.  Actual period return based on the final net returns of portfolio.   

\item Annualized net returns of Fund Series and comparables are for the entirety of each period and are quoted on an Act/360 basis for Lucid Prime Series and Act/365 for Lucid USG series. Any interperiod subscriptions will have different returns based upon the respective interperiod portfolio investments and allocations. Net returns include the applicable series expense ratio and include any management fee waivers or maximum expense caps. Historical returns assume reinvestment at the applicable Fund Series, Libor, T-Bill or MMF Index rate at the end of each period.  Money Market index returns based on the average of the daily rates for the respective period. SOFR is the term reference rate for the applicable period (e.g. 1m or 3m) as published by the CME Group. Fund Series expense ratio currently capped at an all-in ratio of 32.75 bps and can vary over time.

\item All Fund details as of the last period end date. Fund accepts new subscriptions and redemptions on each Withdrawal Date.  Manager may accept subscriptions on any other day with approval, as fully described in the private offering memorandum.

\item Portfolio composition and Over-Collateralization Rate (``O/C Rate'') of the repo investments as of the business day prior to the last day of the most recent period. O/C Rate equals the market value of the collateral as a proportion of the respective repo investments. Eligible repo collateral details and classifications for the Series as fully described in the private offering memorandum.
