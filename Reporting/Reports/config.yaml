  \begin{{enumerate}}
  \item Target returns based on the program manager's estimate of the projected returns for the respective series based on current market conditions. 

  \item Current return (estimated) is based on the rates of the invested series portfolio as of the current period start date.  Actual period return based on the final net returns of portfolio.   
  
  \item Annualized net returns of Fund Series and comparables are for the entirety of each period and are quoted on an Act/360 basis for Lucid Prime Series and Act/365 for Lucid USG series. Any interperiod subscriptions will have different returns based upon the respective interperiod portfolio investments and allocations. Net returns include the applicable series expense ratio and include any management fee waivers or maximum expense caps. Historical returns assume reinvestment at the applicable Fund Series, Libor, T-Bill or MMF Index rate at the end of each period.  Money Market index returns based on the average of the daily rates for the respective period. SOFR is the term reference rate for the applicable period (e.g. 1m or 3m) as published by the CME Group. {exp_rat_footnote}
  
  \item All Fund details as of the last period end date. Fund accepts new subscriptions and redemptions on each Withdrawal Date.  Manager may accept subscriptions on any other day with approval, as fully described in the private offering memorandum.
  
  \item Portfolio composition and Over-Collateralization Rate (``O/C Rate'') of the repo investments as of the business day prior to the last day of the most recent period. O/C Rate equals the market value of the collateral as a proportion of the respective repo investments. Eligible repo collateral details and classifications for the Series as fully described in the private offering memorandum.

  \noindent\textbf{{\color{{lucid_blue}}Report Notes}}
  
  \begin{{enumerate}}
  \item Target returns based on the program manager's estimate of the projected returns for the respective series based on current market conditions. 
  
  \item Current coupon (estimated) is based on the rates of the invested portfolio of the Related Fund Interest as of the current period start date.  Actual rate set in arrears based on the final net returns of portfolio.  
  
  \item Annualized net returns quoted on an Act/360 basis after all program costs. Historical returns assume reinvestment at the respective Series return, money market index, Libor rate or T-Bill Index rate at the end of each period.  Libor is the applicable USD London Interbank offered Rate for each calculation period, as published by the ICE Benchmark Administration Fixing. T-Bill is the offer rate for the T-Bills with a maturity matching the respective coupon period (or interpolated rate if the dates do not match). Crane Prime Institutional Money Market Index adjusted to an Actual/360 basis (for Prime notes) and Act/365 for USG Notes, based on the daily average for the periods. A1/P1 CP is dealer placed commercial paper corresponding to the period as published by Bloomberg. SOFR is the term reference rate for the applicable period (e.g. 1m or 3m) as published by the CME Group.
  
  \item Over-Collateralization Rate (``O/C Rate'') of the repo investments securing the notes in the Related Fund Interest as of the business day prior to the end of the most recent period. O/C Rates will vary each period based on the specific risk characteristics of the collateral securities that meet the Lucid risk management standards. O/C Rate equals the market value of the collateral as a proportion of the respective repo investments. Eligible repo collateral details and classifications for the respective Series as fully described in the private offering memorandum. Historical Returns based on the investment program series performance since inception in the related fund series or notes; accordingly, specific Secured Notes that reference the series (e.g. M-1, M-2) purchased in the middle of coupon dates or issued after the inception date may have different returns based on inter-period issuances or different holding periods. Please review the specific interest rates for the respective secured note CUSIP on page 2 for the specific returns applicable to the note.
  
  \item Program AUM based on the amounts invested in the series strategy through the Secured Notes or directly in the related fund entity (Lucid Prime Fund LLC).  For each program series (e.g. Series M), the returns of the Secured Notes and direct investments in the related fund are the same given the program structure. Lucid Platform AUM is the contracted assets under management as of the report date.
